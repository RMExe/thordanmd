[Example Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQr73hyralc)

## Mechanics

* **Eye of the Tyrant** - Stack damage
* **Lash and Gnash** - Dynamo->Chariot
* **Gnash and Lash** - Chariot->Dynamo
* **Drachenlance** - 45 degree cone AoE in the direction Nidhogg is facing
* **Dark High Jump (Circle)** - AoE marker that drops a tower on the marked player
* **Dark Elusive Jump (Down Arrow)** - AoE marker that drops a tower in front of them (Roughly the boss ring's diameter)
* **Dark Spineshatter Dive(Up Arrow)** - AoE marker that drops a tower in front of them (Roughly the boss ring's diameter)
* **Darkdragon Dive** - 1-3 stack towers
* **Soul Tether** - 2x Tank buster tethers from Nidhogg OR a Darkdragon Dive clone

## Phase Resolution

### Mechanic Order
* Eye of the Tyrant + 3x High/Elusive/Spine(1 Marker) [Lash/Gnash Castbar]
* Lash/Gnash
* 3x Tower + Bait(1 Marker)
* 2x High/Elusive/Spine(2 Marker)
* 2x Tower + Bait(2 Marker)
* Eye of the Tyrant + 3x High/Elusive/Spine(3 Marker)
* Lash/Gnash
* 3x Tower + Bait (3 marker)
* Drachenlance
* 4x Darkdragon Dive Towers
* 2x Soul Tether
* Drachenlance
* Enrage

The mechanics that can come out of each number is fixed:
* 1s and 3s can be **3x High** OR **1x High + 2x Elusive/Spine**
* 2s can be **2x High** OR **1x Elusive + 1x Spine**

When the phase starts, your dice number and mechanic are revealed separately, so you can do a bit of pre-positioning -- 1s start south of Nidhogg, while 2s and 3s start at the north:

From there, the 1 players can spread into cardinals, with High Jump marker for south and either Elusive/Spine or High Jumps in E/W. There are some ways to make positioning consistent and both are just as good in my opinion, just need to agree on one

* We can have 1 players line up south, and people individually resolve their Spine/Elusive markers
* We can always place Elusive(Down) on West and Spine(Up) on East. Placing them this way also ensures that all Elusive/Spine players can resolve their steps by facing West.

For 2 and 3 players, remember that you have the entirety of the first mechanic to resolve your lineup/positioning, but we can still use the same system except in the north.

The tower soak spawns a Nidhogg clone that faces the closest target to it, casting a Geirskogul. This is resolved by having the person soaking the tower facing it away from the center.

### 1 Marker
The 1 players start south, and spread W/S/E for their dives. Afterwards, they go north and the people who went E/W soak the NE/NW 2 Marker tower. The remaining player (South) has to go into the South tower dropped by a 3 Marker

### 2 Marker
The two 2 Marker players have to resolve their markers in the NE/NW away from the boss, either without caring about where they face (High Jump) or having to hit the other player (Elusive/Spine). They then have to take the E/W towers dropped by 3 Marker (NE goes E, NW goes W)

### 3 Marker
The 3 Marker players have to soak the 1 Marker players' towers, then drop their towers in the same spot.

### Darkdragon Dive

For Darkdragon Dive towers, we can split into TH/DPS pairs at fixed positions. The tower setups can have any combination of 1s, 2s, and 3s that add up to 8: (2/2/2/2), (1/1/3/3), (1/3/2/2). This can be resolved by having someone from each 1 tower move to the **closest** 3 tower. This means that a 1 player will never go diagonally, unless 1/3/2/2 can have the 1 and 3 be diagonal to each other(TODO: Determine if this is possible). After towers resolve 3 of the towers will be regular Geirskogul baits (Face them away from the center), and one of them will be a tether that have to be picked up by a tank. 

This phase has rigid positioning and relies on everyone to know what to do as each number, but the mechanics themselves are easy to parse/solve. I recommend watching the example video as it covers virtually everything that you have to do in the phase.
