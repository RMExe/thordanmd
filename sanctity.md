### Holy Dashes

Two paladins spawn east and west, facing opposite directions, one darknight in an intercard near the edge.

Thordan will spawn outside the arena somewhere along with a large eye of nidhogg, both will begin charging a gaze attack, but only thordan will show the gaze marker.

Two random players (complete random selection) will be marked with a single or crossed swords.  Goal is to split into 2 groups of 4, however a 5/3 split is survivable. One group will be directly opposite of dark knight and the other group will be directly behind dark knight.

Make a note of where the paladins are facing, that will be the direction each party will be moving towards (effectively, west paladin facing north will mean clockwise, and south will me counterclockwise).

The 1 marked player must be in the group opposite of the dark knight, and the 2 marked player must be in the group directly behind him.  Both parties should be on an intercard + 3 notches in the direction you will move (refer to image below).  Swap as necessary.  Both groups will likely need to have a healer in them and ideally will have 4, however a 5/3 is split is survivable as long as they are healed after the first stack damage.

Shortly after arriving at the edge, the gaze attack will go off. Make sure you are looking away from BOTH thordan and the eye.  Failing to do so will apply a damage down and hysteria, almost certainly failing you for the next mechanic and putting your group at risk to dying to the stack damage.

The paladins will begin dashing, leaving behind holy orbs.  Meanwhile, the dark knight will plunge the the groups in alternating fashion, dealing shared physical damage and applying a short vuln.

The groups will rotate from the starting intercard towards the cardinal marker, about 3 or 4 notches from the starting position. Refer to gif below

### Fire & Ice
After all the holy dashes resolve, all 8 players should loosely spread around the center.  3 casting knights and 1 axe knight will spawn along with 4 fire puddles and 8 towers.  The towers will be split along the edge of the arena and in the middle.

Two players, either both DPS or both Non-DPS, will get prey marker debuffs. Additionally, all DPS or all Non-DPS will have an overhead marker for placing ice puddles.

Ice puddle markers should place themselves 1 each directly in the middle of the gap between each fire puddle.  The Prey Targets will be in the North and South gap (lined up with A&C), and the non-prey targets in their roles will adjust off them according. If the prey targets have ice puddles, then the non-ice players will stand slightly in front of them.  If the prey targets are not selected for ice puddles, then the non-ice players should stand (including prey markers) directly behind the ice puddle players.  The only real goal/requirement is that the prey markers should be behind.

Each pair will look in their cardinal quadrant.  Outer towers cannot spawn directly on an intercardinal and instead have a middle/left/right alignment in that quadrant. if there are 0 towers behind them, then both players move forward into the middle after the ice puddle drops. If there is 1 tower in quadrant, then the player in the back of the pair will be responsible for moving into it and the front player will move into the middle.  If there are 2 towers in the back quadrant, then both players will cover them. I've never seen then spawn 3 in the same quadrant, so I'm not sure if it's possible.

Players who moved into the middle will just cover any tower they can get to. There's usually only 2 or 3 to speak for in the first place.

Towers will detonate, and the next set of 8 will appear.  These are always on the cardinals and intercards on the outer edge of the arena.

Prey markers will have the towers at N&S/A&C, with each player taking the one opposite of where they started.  Anyone else in the outer ring will then claim a tower.  Finally, the middle players will have to see which towers are free, keeping in mind the pair that are for the prey markers, and should line themselves up.

7 meteors will start dropping on each prey marked player in a regular interval.  The two common ways to handle this are to either trace the curvature of the puddles as you rotate clockwise, or to run around the edge of the arena, both should assure the meteors are sufficiently spaced out.  Around the Fifth meteor, the axe knight in the center will enter a charging stance.  All players on the edge must press their knockback immunity at this point.  Middle players may elect to or forgo this. After the 7th meteor drops you should be nearly 180 degrees opposite of where you started, and should move into the tower.  Puddles will disappear and the knockback will go off.  If you were in the middle you should either be knocked back into the tower, or you should hustle into it if you popped your immunity.

If towers succeed then Thordan will appear and lead up to Ultimate End

## Ultimate End and Enrage
Let's face it, you know how ultimate end works
After ultimate end, thordan will stumble into the arena, point towards a random player and begin casting Broad Swing.

Broad swing will hit in three 120 degree cones, these will knock you back likely killing you on the wall if you get hit.

The first swing will always be towards his front left or front right, and the final swing will always be towards the back.  This is simply dealt with by stacking behind him once he starts casting and moving into the first cone when it goes off.

After the second set of broad swings Thordan will begin casting Aetheric Burst, enrage of the phase.
